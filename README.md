1- What is the role of SQA in SDLC? <br>


SQA plays a vital role throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring quality at each phase. During requirements gathering, SQA ensures clarity, completeness, and accuracy of requirements while helping catch potential ambiguities. In the design phase, it reviews documents to ensure they meet requirements and verifies the design is scalable, secure, and maintainable. During development, SQA promotes coding standards and monitors compliance with development methodologies. In the testing phase, it ensures thorough testing is conducted across unit, integration, system, and acceptance levels. Finally, during deployment and maintenance, SQA ensures proper deployment and continuous quality improvement.

2- What is Software Quality Assurance?
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic set of activities that ensure software processes and products comply with defined standards and procedures for best practices. It involves monitoring and improving the entire software development lifecycle to ensure the quality of the software product. The key objectives include ensuring software meets customer expectations, improving development processes to reduce defects, and ensuring adherence to industry standards. SQA is characterized by three key aspects: it is process-oriented (focusing on improving processes), preventive (aiming to prevent defects), and comprehensive (covering all phases of the software lifecycle).

3- What are the Types of Test Plans?
Test plans can be categorized into several types:
- Unit Test Plan: Focuses on testing individual components or modules
- Integration Test Plan: Covers testing of integrated components
- System Test Plan: Addresses testing of the complete system
- Acceptance Test Plan: Validates that the system meets business requirements
- Performance Test Plan: Tests system performance under various conditions
- Security Test Plan: Focuses on security testing aspects
Each type of test plan serves a specific purpose in the overall testing strategy and includes detailed information about test objectives, scope, resources, and schedules.

4- What are the Levels of Software Testing?
Software testing is conducted at four main levels:
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components or units of code, typically done by developers
2. Integration Testing: Tests interactions between integrated units or components
3. System Testing: Tests the complete system as a whole to verify all components work together
4. Acceptance Testing: Ensures the system meets business requirements and is typically performed by end-users or clients

5- What are the Test Approaches?
The main testing approaches are:
- White Box Testing: Examines internal logic of the software application
- Black Box Testing: Tests functionality without knowledge of internal code
- Grey Box Testing: Combines aspects of both white box and black box testing, with partial knowledge of internal workings
Each approach has specific applications and advantages in the testing process.

6- Why Transform From Manual to Automated Testing?
The transformation from manual to automated testing is driven by several factors:
- Quality Assurance: Automated testing reduces human error and improves test coverage
- Error Detection: Automation testing is more efficient at detecting bugs compared to manual testing
- Resource Optimization: Reduces the need for extensive human intervention in testing
- Time and Cost Efficiency: While initial investment is higher, automation saves time and resources in the long run
- Test Coverage: Enables more comprehensive testing with the ability to run more test cases

7- What are the Non-Functional Testing types?
Non-functional testing includes:
- Performance Testing: Examines system behavior under various load conditions
- Usability Testing: Assesses user-friendliness and accessibility
- Compatibility Testing: Verifies software works across different platforms and environments
- Security Testing: Checks for vulnerabilities and security issues
- Scalability Testing: Tests system's ability to handle increased load

8- What are the Advantages of Automation Testing?
Key advantages include:
- Simplified test case execution with minimal supervision
- Improved reliability of tests through consistent execution
- Increased test coverage capability
- Reduced human intervention and associated errors
- Time and cost savings in the long run
- Earlier detection of defects through continuous testing

9- What are the Automation Testing types?
Automation testing includes several types:
- Unit testing: Testing individual code components
- Integration testing: Testing combined software modules
- Smoke testing: Basic functionality testing
- Performance testing: System performance evaluation
- Regression testing: Ensuring existing functionality works after changes
- Security testing: Checking for security vulnerabilities
- API testing: Testing application programming interfaces
- UI Testing: Validating user interface elements and functionality
