                answer: `Software testing is conducted at four main levels:
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components or units of code, typically done by developers.
2. Integration Testing: Tests interactions between integrated units or components.
3. System Testing: Tests the complete system as a whole to verify all components work together.
4. Acceptance Testing: Ensures the system meets business requirements and is typically performed by end-users or clients.`,

                answer: `The main testing approaches are:
- White Box Testing: Examines internal logic of the software application.
- Black Box Testing: Tests functionality without knowledge of internal code.
- Grey Box Testing: Combines aspects of both white box and black box testing, with partial knowledge of internal workings.
Each approach has specific applications and advantages in the testing process.`,
